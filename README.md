These exercises will challenge your problem solving ability using any language (our solutions use Ruby). They range from simple one-liners to several small methods. We assume that you have mastered basic Ruby syntax, and you must apply that knowledge in a variety of ways to arrive at a solution. Most exercises can be completed in multiple ways, so take time to think about the tradeoffs of various approaches. Don't be concerned if your solution is considerably different; that's normal and expected.
